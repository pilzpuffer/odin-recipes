This project was meant as a practice for my HTML skills

Based on the task requirements, I've created a website that consists of 4 pages: homepage + 3 different recipe cards

While working on this website, I've practiced making lists and got used to the basic website structure that can be enabled purely by HTML - I'm quite happy with the basic navigation I've added (which wasn't a part of the intial task) that allows users to go back to the main page from each recipe card. 

Also, I've practiced using header, img and anchor elements. 

As course progressed - I've also added CSS styling to this project.

At this point I've decided that I wasn't entirely happy with my initial decision to use AI-generated "photographs", but since this project was made during the "entry" part of the course and only exists as a practice, I've decided to leave it as it is instead of fully remaking it. If I'll be revisiting this project in the future, I intend to re-make it from scratch - and will use better pictures as well.

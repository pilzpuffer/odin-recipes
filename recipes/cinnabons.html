        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, melted butter, eggs, salt, and 4 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes, gradually adding the remaining ½ cup of flour until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out into a 16x21-inch rectangle.</li>
            <li>Spread softened butter over the dough and sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Starting from the long edge, roll the dough tightly into a log and cut into 12 equal slices.</li>
            <li>Place the cinnamon rolls in a greased baking dish, cover, and let them rise for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese icing by mixing cream cheese, softened butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
            <li>Once the cinnamon rolls are baked, let them cool slightly before drizzling with cream cheese icing. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>

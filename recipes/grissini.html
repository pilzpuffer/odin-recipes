        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
